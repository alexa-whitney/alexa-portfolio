## About

Transitioning from a background in criminal justice to the realm of technology, I bring forth a unique blend of analytical rigor and creative problem-solving. This portfolio is a testament to that journey, highlighting my passion for front-end and back-end development, my ability to learn rapidly, and my quest to craft meaningful and impactful software solutions.

## Technologies

In building this portfolio, I've employed a stack that ensures responsiveness, performance, and maintainability:

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling with a nod to best practices.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic interactions and front-end features.
- **React**: Leveraged for its powerful component-based architecture.
- **Bootstrap & React-Bootstrap**: For responsive design elements.
- **SASS**: Because clean, organized CSS is a priority.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Mailchimp**: Integrated for newsletter subscriptions and user engagement.

## Features

- **Typewriter Effect**: Dynamic and engaging text animation on the landing page.
- **Smooth Scroll**: Seamless navigation through different sections.
- **Mailchimp Integration**: For newsletter sign-ups directly from the footer.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for accessibility across all devices.
- **Project Showcase**: Curated display of my most significant projects.
